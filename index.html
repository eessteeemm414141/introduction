                <h2>B.V. (Before Vinz)</h2>
                <p>
                  My parents came from the Northern Luzon, in the Valleys of
                  Cagayan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They lived there and had their first son before coming to
                  Cavite
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since then, my family lived in a subdivision here between
                  General Trias, Dasmarinas, and Imus Cavite. Outside our
                  subdivision are literally three different pathways that leads
                  to three different cities xD
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although we are in Cavite, I was born in a hospital in Manila
                  because my mother needed C-section in delivering me and I
                  believe Hospitals in Cavite was not able to do that

                  My oldest memory dates back when I was 3 years old. I remember
                  saying to my mom my interest in going to school since I got
                  bored alone. I remember standing on top of a cabinet while
                  saying this and them jumping back down.

                <p>5 years old, my brother introduced me to Dota.</p>
                <p>
                  It has a funny correlation that I repeated kinder the same
                  time I started playing Dota.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is definitely only a correlation though, I would rarely
                  play Dota and only play the classic Facebook games during that
                  time such as Pet Society, Dragon and Restaurant City.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is also where my years of gaming addiction would start

                <p>Gaming Addiction Arc</p>
                <p>This is where my gaming addiction would start.</p>
                <p>
                  Just like going to school, this is caused by 'following my
                  elder brother' to a different internet cafe where he plays on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The internet cafe is owned by his classmate's family, which is
                  my classmate's family because the because our classmates were
                  also bros
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is when I got introduced to League of Legends, arguably
                  the 'better' Dota. I made a lot of friends in that internet
                  cafe which I think is what made gaming really special for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                  1 year later I would go to the cafe almost everyday for at
                  least an hour playing either League of Legends or Minecraft
                </p>

                <h2>2016</h2>
                <p>The Great Leap</p>
                <p>I entered a highschool from another city, 8km away.</p>
                <p>
                  It was a great experience for me that I think made a
                  significant impact on who I am becoming.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First, of all it is a public school and I came from a private
                  school. Our room was full of mosquitoes, It wasn't air
                  conditioned and I am very sweaty, we had clean our own room,
                  wax and polish the floor, do reportings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although these aren't actually all that bad and hard, I was
                  quick to adjust and already experienced worse living
                  conditions on my life. The worse things really is waking up
                  early in the morning and then getting home late due to
                  traffic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Aaand the workload of being in their 'Special Science
                  Curriculum' which makes us study additional advanced subjects
                  (which lost its value when k-12 was added) and be on the
                  school the whole day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was also humbling because I became just another fish in the
                  ocean, after being always top of the class during elementary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Only good thing is that now everything heavy that gets on my
                  way feels 'doable' compared to the stress that I had during
                  jhs which makes me feel strong.

                  It was very exciting. I imagined all the possibility, all the

                  tried to learn more about myself and those things.

                This image was taken by my friend Aldrin. This was during the
                second career week on my school on my 10th Grade, when we were
                preparing in line to go to our school gymnasium to present
                ourselves on the stage to the whole school.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this picture, I am wearing a gray hoodie which used to be my
                brother's, my P.E. pants, and a 5$ headset while holding a
                classic a4tech keyboard and my mouse on the right. The other
                people around me are all of my classmates, and the background is
                my school's field. I like this picture because it really reminds
                me myself.
              </p>
              <p>
                The day before this was a bit stressful since I do not really
                know what to wear, since I do not know what career / profession
                I want to represent since I also do not really have a dream job.
                Who dreams of becoming a laborer anyway? I just want to have
                fun. So I just brought some of my computer peripherals with me
                to school.
              </p>
              <p>
                Preparing for the it was really exciting and fun and very
                thrilling. I did not know if my teacher is going to scold me.
                During our discussion about the event, I joked about going as a
                professional esports player. He did not really enjoy the joke,
                which made me more motivated to come even though I might be
                embarassing, but I did it anyway. It was also really cool to be
                part of the "1%" because I'm literally the only one who dressed
                up as a 'gamer' that day.
              </p>
              <p>
                What I really liked about this picture is my smile. It reminds
                me of that memorable week. It was stressful to have a whole week
                discussing about careers when I do not have that kind of vision
                like everyone else. All I really want to do is to "have fun", so
                that is what I did on stage. I ran around the stage when it was
                my time and acted like my keyboard was a gun, tumbling and
                firing rounds at every seat in the gymnasium.

            <h1>Movie</h1>
            <p>
              I do not really watch a lot of movies. I am unsure why, but I
              think it is because playing games is just a more stimulating
              activity with friends in general so watching a movie 'is a waste
              of time'.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also easily get bored in watching movies. Those that have a lot
              of dialogue between people in order to explain the story rather
              than 'show' it is boring, which is why I am more inclined on
              action ones like Marvel movies (although I've seen like only
              Ironman) and war movies. Also because I only mostly digest what is
              on the surface, since I am bad in connecting tiny details. I read
              a lot of movie discussions to look for other people's thoughts for
              this reason.
            </p>
            <p>
              Just to answer though, my favorite would be
              <span class="color">Spiderman: Into The Spiderverse</span> because
              it is cool and flashy. Everyone loves spiderman, he is the most
              famous and relatable hero for younger audiences. Miles Morales is
              specially cool becuase of his black suit. It is also like the last
              movie that I watched.
            </p>
            <p>
              For movie series, I like The Big Bang Theory. It's like an
              acquired liking since my bro and uncle watched it together a lot
              when I was a kid, it was funny cause I understood nothing of the
              jokes back then. Scorpion is also decent. KDrama's are the best
              though, I'd rank Itaewon Class as the best, Start-up second, and
              then Descedants of the Sun.

            <h1>Food</h1>
            <p>In food, I like sour and savory foods.</p>
            <p>
              My mother knows that I like my bowl looking like an island with
              2:1 rice to soup ratio. According to her,
              <span class="color">Sinigang</span> is my favorite food and I like
              it extra sour. Sometimes she even separately cooks my Sinigang to
              their sinigang so that she could put more soury taste to my soup.
              I also won't never say no to Mang Inasal's sinigang mix soup.
            </p>
            <p>
              If its not soup, I like saucy foods. Although my mom gets very
              busy sometimes so most of the food I eat are fried chicken, frozen
              foods, and canned foods. When I do not like the cooked food,
              century tuna, 555 tuna afrida, caldereta, or youngstown sardines
              are my go to.
            </p>
            <p>
              My other top foods are the Bicol Express that my high school
              cooks, the brown and savory beef dish (idk name) that I ate on my
              friends house during their fiesta.

            <h1>Book</h1>
            <p>
              Not sure if I should already have a favorite after reading less
              than 5 books
            </p>
            <p>
              Book reading is a new hobby that I am trying to put into my
              system. It started when I saw one of those self-development gurus
              on tiktok xD.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first book I read and the only book I finished is Rich Dad and
              Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki. It was a really nice introductory to
              finance. From then, I started exploring many self-development
              books.
            </p>
            <p>
              From all the books that I started, I believe that
              <span class="color">Thinking Fast and Slow</span> by Daniel
              Kahneman is one that would have the most value. Although all the
              other ones, including Atomic Habits, is also nice, this book is
              inline with my interest in human mind, in thinking and behavior in
              general. I am actually not yet even half-way through, or even a
              quarter way through the book but I think it is really good.

            <h1>Game</h1>
            <p>
              Alas, with (a bit less than) 10,000 hours,
              <span class="color">League of Legends</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              I have played this game more than any other game, or any other
              things that I did on my life (except, of course, being forced to
              study) XD
            </p>
            <p>
              First played this around Season 2 - 3, and its on Season 13 right
              now. It changes every year, which means It has been around 10
              years.
            </p>
            <p>
              At this point, playing the game has become my relaxation despite
              the fact that I sweat a lot even though I am just sitting and
              moving my hands.
            </p>
            <p>
              I dreamed really big for LoL. I wanted to become a pro player in
              the game. I was hoping to play as a varsity in college but I
              didn't get accepted to the school which has a great LoL Team, and
              I was also too weak to be accepted as a member in my school's
              team. I was just not that great, I blame that I have less time for
              practice since I still put a significant amount of focus to
              school. xD
            </p>
            <p>
              Another reason why I played League of Legends a lot is because the
              game has low minimum requirements that is perfect for my pc. Even
              Minecraft, my second most played game, became heavier for my pc to
              run.
